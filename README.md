### How do I contribute?
 - Each language has it's own folder within the `locales` sub directory.
 - The `english` language within `en` folder contains the master translations that can be referenced.
 - Create a new sub folder within `locales` with the 2 letter abbreviation of your langauge (e.g. `Dutch` with be `de`) and copy the contents of the `en` folder inside.
 - Edit the files within your langauge to reflect the translations in your language.

 - The mod launcher will receive a future update with your translations in the future.

### Things to watch out for
 - The content inside of `{{stuffLikeThis}}` are variables and should NOT be translated, these variables will be filled automatically with dynamic content.
 - The contents inside of angled bracket `<0>like this</0>` should be translated, but take care to keep the `<0>` and `</0>` exactly as they are, do not add any extra spacing or the translations will break.
