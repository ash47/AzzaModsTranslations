 - The `english` language within `en` folder contains the master translations that can be referenced.

### Things to watch out for
 - The content inside of `{{stuffLikeThis}}` are variables and should NOT be translated, these variables will be filled automatically with dynamic content.
 - The contents inside of angled bracket `<0>like this</0>` should be translated, but take care to keep the `<0>` and `</0>` exactly as they are, do not add any extra spacing or the translations will break.
